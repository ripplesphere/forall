            Pastor Tony and volunteers from
            A&Z God's Ministry For All People
            go weekly to some of our local Nursing Homes to visit and pray with the residents.
            Pastor Tony meets with homeless at Shelters to offer Spiritual Guidance.
            Our ministry also does Weddings and Funerals. Our ministry offers free Bible 
            courses and activities with the youth.

             We strive to help people find Christ and live Christ-like lives. 
             We like to present a positive and practical message that can be applied 
             to every person's life. The Nursing Home residents were someone's mother 
             or father. God loves them, and He has sent us to help make their day brighter.
