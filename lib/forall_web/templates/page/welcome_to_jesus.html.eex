<h3>Welcome to Jesus!</h3>
At <b>A&Z God's Ministry for All People</b> we understand everything the Savior “Jesus” does for us, He becomes the most important person in our lives. Christianity is not about signing up for a religion. Christianity is about being born into the family of God. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" target="_blank">John 3:3</a> Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.” Without the cross there is no Salvation.  Clearly, the first command is to take up our cross. The earthly result of our Christian faith should be to imitate Christ in all aspects of our life.    And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm" target="_blank">Acts 4:12</a> If you've recently decided to commit your life to Jesus, you might be thinking, “Now what?” When you choose to follow Jesus, you don’t just have a new faith: you begin a relationship. But what does it mean to be in a relationship with God? We’ll explore these and other questions to help you get started on this exciting adventure.<br>

<h3>The life of a Christian or  Christ-follower!</h3>                                                                        Here is what I see are the differences between Christians and Christ-followers. (First off, let me say there is nothing wrong with the label of “Christian”, But Christin and Religion can not save us but Jesus Christ can save you if you are a Christ-follower. <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" target="_blank">John 3:16 (NIV)</a> <i>16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</i> We need to help all people, even true believers, understand that being a Christian is not just a title or label. It is something you are and something you do. You believe in Jesus, so you follow Jesus. Wherever He leads. This implies lordship. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm" target="_blank">2 Peter 3:18 ESV</a>. <i>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</i><br>
<br>
What is a Christ-follower? That is when someone looks at you and sees only Christ. There is only one way God can make that transformation in you and me, and that is through our submission. <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm" target="_blank">John 1:12 ASV</a> <i>But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name:</i> There is truth behind this saying, yet Christ does far more than make our lives completely fulfilling.

<h3>The promises of God?</h3>
The Bible is the word of God and is powerful and life changing. The promises of God start with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16</a> when God tells us that all Scriptures in the Bible are inspired by God. With this promise of God in hand we can then be assured that what we learn in the Bible comes from Him!
There are many, many promises of God in Scripture. In each promise, God pledges that something will, or will not, be done or given or come to pass.
<a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm" target="_blank">Romans 10:9</a> <i>If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</i>
<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm" target="_blank">Matthew 11:28-29</a> <i>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</i>
<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-29.htm" target="_blank">Isaiah 40:29-31</a> <i>He gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless.  Even youths will become weak and tired, and young men will fall in exhaustion.  But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength.  They will soar high on wings like eagles.  They will run and not grow weary.  They will walk and not faint.</i>
<a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm" target="_blank">Philippians 4:19</a> <i>And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.</i>
<a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-37.htm" target="_blank">Romans 8:37-39</a> <i>No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us. Jesus promised that He will return for us</i>
(<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm" target="_blank">John 14:2–3</a>) From then on, we will be with Him always.  
There are many more promises of God that could be listed. All of them find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, “the radiance of God’s glory” (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" target="_blank">Hebrews 1:3</a>). “No matter how many promises God has made, they are ‘Yes’ in Christ” (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).
